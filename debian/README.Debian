debinstall
==========

By default, the debinstall user is created as a system user (i.e. without home and shell).
It can be interesting in some case to change that behaviour (ssh access, home dir, ...)::

	# deluser debinstall
	# adduser --system --group debinstall --shell /bin/rbash

Be cautious if files already exist with the previous uid of debinstall.
